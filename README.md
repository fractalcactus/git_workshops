# git_workshops

Each exercise consists of:
1. a bash script which creates a repository, and adds commits
1. a problem to solve that uses that repository. The repository is a safe sandbox to experiment with Git commands, while also having a realistic history of commits


## How to run the exercises

- run `bash exercise_<exercise_number>` to set up for the exercise.

  e.g for exercise 2, run `bash exercise_2`

- `cd` into the repository that the previous script created. The newly created repository will be named `repo_<exercise_number>`

   e.g for exercise 2, run `cd repo_2`
   (Note that the `exercise_2` script will delete and reinstantiate any existing `repo_2`)

- Read the exercise instructions, and try to solve the challenge

- Answers are below the exercises
